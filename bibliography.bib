	url = {https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527808465.EMC2016.6175},
	abstract = {Using the signals of four backscattered electron (BSE) detectors with different detection angles in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) the three-dimensional surface topography of various samples, i.e. catalysts, fractured surfaces and micro-devices can be derived and analyzed [1], [2]. An efficient shape from shading reconstruction algorithm is applied to these signals to extract high resolution height and texture information. The surface reconstruction is very fast and needs no sample tilting since the surface topography is calculated from the four simultaneous recorded backscattered electron images. While the 3D reconstruction of the surface topography works very well, the calculation of quantitative height differences depends on different imaging and geometric parameters and requires a calibration of the used BSE detectors. This includes the adjustment of gain and offset of the signals as well as the checking of the geometrical properties of the detector, i.e. detector radius, height, detection area and the horizontal angle to the scan rotation. Especially the height determination, which also depends on the adjustment of the working distance, is hard to determine. Therefore, a spatial calibration is applied with the help of 3D calibration standards [3]. As a result, not only lateral scaling factors, but also z-scale and shearing effects are estimated. Furthermore, nonlinear deviations are calculated and allow an evaluation of the local and overall accuracy of topographic data, which is achieved applying 3D reconstruction using a calibrated 4Q-BSE detector. For better accuracy, the reconstruction algorithm was improved by applying refined geometry for the primary and the backscattered electron beam. At low magnifications, the electron beam is not perpendicular to a horizontal specimen surface and the distribution of the backscattered electrons is not isotropic. In addition, the distance between the specimen and the detector is not constant for all image points. Without consideration and correction, this yields to spherical distorted surfaces. The advanced 3D reconstruction algorithm includes geometrical improvements, allowing a distortion-free mapping of the surface topography over a large magnification range. As an example for application of 3D reconstruction in material sciences, fracture surfaces of a copper base alloy were analyzed. The applied SEM (Hitachi S-520) is equipped with a complete digital imaging system and in particular with a 4-quadrant BSE detector (point electronic GmbH) and was geometrically calibrated using a 3D calibration standard. Thus, the spatial scale factors were determined for a magnification of 1000x to cx = 1.013, cy = 1.024, cz = 1.198. While the remaining maximum geometrical deviations after application of these calibration parameters were evaluated with dx = 60 nm, dy = 41 nm and dz = 57 nm the spatial mean deviations for the whole measurement volume is 16 nm. The figures present some results of the investigation. The upper row of pictures shows the dimpled surface microstructure of a forced fracture where the material mostly cracks in a ductile trans-crystalline manner. The pictures of the bottom row show some crystallographically oriented facets of a fatigue fracture of the same material. On the left for both cases the secondary electron (SE) images are shown, on the right side pictures of the 3D reconstructions of the BSE images are presented. Height differences can be visualised immediately whereas more complex data will be derived from the 3D datasets. The improved 3D reconstruction algorithm is available as standalone software version as well as integrated solution for SEM. Integration into a SEM system allows not only on-line 3D visualisation, but also easier calibration and especially more reliable application, because full control over all relevant physical and imaging parameters is guaranteed. The integrated topographic 3D reconstruction was developed in cooperation with point electronic GmbH and is now available within their SEM control hard- and software DISS. Therefore we like to thank point electronic GmbH for the fruitful cooperation.},

The authors used a quadruple secondary electron detector system and new numerical procedures for signal processing, which quite effectively curb main errors inherent in the method. Results of experiments prove that the vertical inaccuracy of the reconstructed shape may be reduced below 10\% of the view field dimensions, if local surface inclination angles are less than 65$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$. Thus, a SEM equipped with the system designed by the authors may serve as a tool for the inspection and measurement of geometrical issues for several classes of micro-mechanical structures.},

However, even nowadays it is still a challenging task to device a method that combines the flexibility to deal with non-trivial computational domains with high accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency. In this paper we propose to use for the first time in the literature Krylov subspace solvers as a main step in tackling the task. While these methods can be very efficient, they may only show their full potential when combined with a numerical preconditioning and even more importantly, a suitable initialization. To address the latter issue we propose to compute this initial state via a recently developed fast marching integrator. Numerical experiments prove the benefits of this novel combination.},

	annote = {A configuration of semiconductor detectors of backscattered electrons for a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is presented. The variable width of the detector rings and their oblique arrangement in the electron detection plane increases the detection efficiency by several times, thus making it possible to better separate the contrasts of surface-topography images and the studied-sample composition. By varying the accelerating voltage of the SEM and simultaneously choosing the appropriate detection angles of backscattered electrons, a sharper separation of layer-by-layer images of details of subsurface microstructures can be attained. It is shown that using a semiconductor detector and taking its response function (instrument function) into account, proximate assessments of the thicknesses of ultrathin nanometer-size film coatings on massive substrates can be performed.},

	abstract = {The reconstruction of three-dimensional surface topographies can be done in two principally different ways: conventional stereoscopy and `shape from shading'. In conventional stereoscopy the depth information is obtained from two perspective views of the specimen. For that, perspectively corresponding features have to be identified in both views to determine depth from perspective shift. Conventional stereoscopy normally results in a relatively sparse set of irregularly distributed points whose elevations are known precisely. The shape-from-shading approach determines the local surface orientation from the local surface luminosity. Over a limited range of surface inclinations the emission of secondary (SE) and back-scattered (BSE) electrons depends uniquely on the angle between electron beam and local surface normal of the specimen. Shape from shading uses this relationship to determine the surface normal with multiple detectors mounted in different take-off directions. Contrary to conventional stereoscopy shape from shading yields depth information from each surface point, but this method is less accurate than stereoscopy. In this paper we propose a combination of both approaches, in which the dense, but less accurate results from shape from shading are used to fill the gaps in the sparsely distributed, but very accurately known, depth information obtained from stereoscopy.},

The idea behind this technique is simply to perform STEM-in-SEM, that is SEM in transmission mode, in an environmental SEM. The purpose of the present contribution is to highlight the main advances that contributed to development of the wet-STEM technique. Although simple in principle, the wet-STEM imaging mode would have been limited before high brightness electron sources became available, and needed some progresses and improvements in ESEM. This new technique extends the scope of SEM as a high-resolution microscope, relatively cheap and widely available imaging tool, for a wider variety of samples.},

Other chirality related properties that are actually intensively investigated are unconventional superconductivity or unusual magnetic ordering like skyrmions in materials with B20 structure. Despite the often close crystal structure - property relation, its detection is often challenging due to superposition of domains with different absolute structure e.g. chirality. Our investigations of high quality CoSi crystals with B20 structure by both complementary methods X- ray (volume sensitive) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) (surface sensitive) results the consistent assignment of the chirality and reveal fundamental differences in their sensitivity to chirality. The analysis of the surface of a CoSi crystal with domains of different chirality show the high spatial resolution of this method which opens the possibility to analyze the chirality in microstructures of technical relevant materials like thin films and catalysts.},

	title = {Application of {BIB}-{SEM} technology to characterize meso-and macropore morphology in coal},
	abstract = {Coalbeds are very heterogenous in composition, which in turn affects the connectivity and transport of fluids within the coal. The composition of a coalbed influences the pore structure. Pore structure as well as pore size distribution are two important parameters used in estimating reservoir properties. This study examines the morphology and distribution of macro-and mesopores in coal samples, using broad ion beam (BIB) milling to prepare relief-and damage-free polished surfaces of coal samples for high-resolution SEM imaging. The BIB-sections of a few square millimeters are not large enough to be statistically representative so that the results cannot be easily interpreted from a coal seam standpoint. Therefore, porosity was investigated as a function of maceral type to characterize pore morphologies. Macerals were selected from the vitrinite group, e.g. telocollinite, and from the inertinite group, e.g. fusinite and macrinite. The selected macerals were BIB-milled parallel to bedding and subsequently milled perpendicular to bedding. Pore morphology and pore size distribution was examined in each of the milled sections. For a vitrinite maceral type, we found no visible macroporosity within the resolution limits of the SE detector. Pore morphology in an inertinite maceral is dependent on the original maceral. Fusinite yields large, elongated pores (often filled with mineralization), while macrinite shows comparatively smaller, rounder pores. The BIB-milled sections perpendicular to bedding often showed an alternating sequence of bedding, with bed thicknesses varying between a few micrometers to greater than half a millimeter. The distribution of pores is also reflected by bed thickness in the sections perpendicular to bedding, with many pores being concentrated in association with the beds. The distribution of pore sizes follows a similar power law at different magnifications of the same BIB-milled surface. Our results show that micropores and macropores in coal belong to different populations, with different size distributions and morphologies. Furthermore, each maceral type studied yielded a different power law distribution. BIB-SEM imaging is a useful tool to study meso-and macropore morphology, especially in the size range between 10 nm and 10 ¬µm. In a future study, more maceral types should be examined for a better characterization of maceral porosity at different stages of coalification.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of LV-SEM for renal biopsy specimens. We analyzed 20 renal biopsy samples obtained for diagnostic purposes. The sections were stained with periodic acid methenamine silver to enhance the contrast, and subsequently examined by LV-SEM. LV-SEM showed a precise and fine structure of the glomerulus in both formalin fixed paraffin and glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide-fixed epoxy resin sections up to 10,000-fold magnification. The spike formation on the basement membrane was clearly observed in the membranous nephropathy samples. Similarly to transmission electron microscopy, electron dense deposits were observed in the epoxy resin sections of the IgA nephropathy and membranous nephropathy samples. LV-SEM could accurately show various glomerular lesions at high magnification after a simple and rapid processing of the samples. We consider that this is a novel and useful diagnostic tool for renal pathologies.},

	abstract = {Organic petrography via incident light microscopy has broad application to shale petroleum systems, including delineation of thermal maturity windows and determination of organo-facies. Incident light microscopy allows practitioners the ability to identify various types of organic components and demonstrates that solid bitumen is the dominant organic matter occurring in shale plays of peak oil and gas window thermal maturity, whereas oil-prone Type I/II kerogens have converted to hydrocarbons and are not present. High magnification SEM observation of an interconnected organic porosity occurring in the solid bitumen of thermally mature shale reservoirs has enabled major advances in our understanding of hydrocarbon migration and storage in shale, but suffers from inability to confirm the type of organic matter present. Herein we review organic petrography applications in the North American shale plays through discussion of incident light photographic examples. In the first part of the manuscript we provide basic practical information on the measurement of organic reflectance and outline fluorescence microscopy and other petrographic approaches to the determination of thermal maturity. In the second half of the paper we discuss applications of organic petrography and SEM in all of the major shale petroleum systems in North America including tight oil plays such as the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Niobrara, and shale gas and condensate plays including the Barnett, Duvernay, Haynesville-Bossier, Marcellus, Utica, and Woodford, among others. Our review suggests systematic research employing correlative high resolution imaging techniques and in situ geochemical probing is needed to better document hydrocarbon storage, migration and wettability properties of solid bitumen at the pressure and temperature conditions of shale reservoirs.},

	abstract = {1. The fibrillar networks of adult human articular cartilage, taken from femoral and acetabular specimens, have been systematically examined by scanning electron microscopy. The internal structures revealed by rupturing the tissue were compared with published findings from transmission electron microscope studies.2. Though this technique demonstrated the internal fibrillar appearance of cartilage to a remarkable degree, it had several attendant limitations. On final drying, specimens generally exhibited shrinkage which varied within wide limits; this could have altered the internal architecture to some extent. In addition, the rupturing technique, which at the time of this investigation was the only satisfactory method of revealing the fibrillar cartilage structure, may well have had a great influence on the fibril orientations.3. The fibrils revealed no characteristic collagen periodicity and were considerably thicker than those observed by transmission electron microscopy. It is suggested that a coating of mucin on the collagen fibrils might account for this.4. At low magnifications the torn layers in the fractured surfaces extended radially from the calcified zone and turned obliquely at or near the articular surface to merge with the distinctly layered superficial zone, thus forming arcade-like structures. That these were not artefacts produced by the fracturing technique was shown by their similarity to the classical arcade pattern of light microscopy. However, the factor which governed the direction of these planes of weakness, be it collagen, mucopolysaccharides or cells, could not be satisfactorily determined.5. At higher magnifications only three regions of distinct fibrillar organisation could be identified: 1) a surface layer consisting of a random fibrillar network; 2) a superficial zone composed of layers of fibrillar network, intersecting and overlapping in planes parallel to the surface; and 3) elsewhere below the superficial zone a network of virtually random fibrils which extended to the calcified region with apparently little variation in thickness or density. There was little variation from this pattern even in aged fibrillated specimens.6. At the lower magnification range the scanning electron microscope has revealed the arcade pattern described by light microscopy, while at the higher magnifications the fibrillar organisation as seen by scanning electron microscopy correlated well with the concepts developed by transmission electron microscopy, that is, a random network of fibrils overlaid at the articular surface by a membrane-like system of bundled fibrils.7. A possible role in the transmission of joint forces is outlined for the above fibrillar organisation.},

The results show that temperature and the type of coke have an important effect on these structural parameters. Maximum Lc values and lowest d002 values were obtained for the pitch coke and the coke produced from coal with 20wt.\% coal tar pitch addition heated at 2400$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. Differences in crystallographic parameters of the cokes examined also become manifest through their surface morphology.

	doi = {10.1016/j.coal.2017.10.010},
	abstract = {Sample polishing by argon ion beam is a widely used method for examining shale samples for inherent porosity characteristics; the high quality of these surfaces suggests that this technique may also be used for optical reflectance measurements to provide information about the thermal maturity of samples. Yet, the inevitable surface heating that this polishing method engenders has raised concerns that the measured reflectance properties are no longer those of the original sample. To explore the impact of ion milling on the maturity of shale samples as measured by vitrinite and solid bitumen reflectance, five different ion milling configurations were applied to a set of organic-rich New Albany Shale (Late Devonian-Early Mississippian) samples that range in maturity from immature to post-mature. Using two ion mill designs, edge milling vs planar milling, single and dual ion beams, variable acceleration voltages, and milling at room temperature vs samples cooled by liquid nitrogen, provided a wide range of beam heating scenarios. Reflectance of macerals was measured before and after ion milling to investigate whether and to what extent various ion-milling approaches change the reflectance values, and by extension the perceived thermal maturity of organic matter in these samples. Our results demonstrate that more aggressive milling methods, such as the use of multiple beams and higher acceleration voltages elevate reflectance values, and that this effect is most pronounced in immature samples and diminishes for samples of increasing original maturity. Specifically, for the two least mature samples, the most aggressive milling method (configuration D) increased reflectance of vitrinite from 0.48\% to 0.58\%, and from 0.58\% to 0.74\%. Increase of reflectance (perceived maturity) can be counteracted by reducing beam intensity (e.g., fewer beams, lower voltage) and cooling of samples with liquid nitrogen. The severity of heating artifacts depends partially on the ion mill design, and non-damaging settings must be determined experimentally for a given ion mill model. Because thermal alteration of organic matter typically involves the expulsion of volatiles, there is also a danger that ion beam heating of immature and oil window samples can skew the porosity characteristics of shale samples. Thus, determining non-damaging ion mill settings has the dual benefit of avoiding measuring false maturity levels and misleading porosity characteristics.},

Pollen characters including ornamentation, shape, apertural pattern, pollen symmetry, colpus length, width, and margins used to detect the similarities and dissimilarities between genera and also species of the same genus. In this study pollen features of 20 monocot species belonging to 15 genera of the Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, Iridaceae, Ixioliriaceae, Liliaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). In this study two species that is Zephyranthes citrina and Tulbaghia violacea were reported for the first time from Pakistan. Pollen grains were visualized with LM. Non-acetolyzed and acetolyzed pollen were examined using SEM. A taxonomic key was developed to highlight the variation in pollen features in order to make their systematic application for correct species identification.},

	abstract = {Excavations at the 14th century Moorish rampart (Granada, Spain) unearthed a brick oven alongside black ash and bone stratigraphic layers. In situ evidence suggests the oven served to fabricate a wall coating including powdered burnt bones. Original ad hoc analyses improved on conventional methods were used to confirm this hypothesis. These methods enable (i) nondestructive micro-X-ray diffraction (Œº-XRD) for fast mineralogical data acquisition (‚àº10 s) and moderately high spatial (‚àº500 Œºm) resolution and (ii) identification and imaging of crystalline components in sample cross-sections via mineral maps, yielding outstanding visualization of grain distribution and morphology in composite samples based on scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersion X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX) elemental maps. Benefits are shown for applying diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) vs transmittance-FT-IR (T-FT-IR) to analyze organic and inorganic components in single samples. Complementary techniques to fully characterize artifacts were gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), optical microscopy (OM), conventional powder XRD, and 14C dating. Bone-hydroxyapatite was detected in the coating. Mineralogical transformations in the bricks indicate oven temperatures well above 1000 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, supporting the hypothesis.},

It was found that the formation of spherules and slag is not destructive with respect to the host coke matrix. On the contrary, the octahedral spinel crystals, which grow from the aluminosilicate spherules gradually expose \{111\} faces and edges and change the shape and possibly volume of the parental mineral matter. The sharp and straight edges probably cause cracks to appear in the coke matrix, leading to a weakening of its strength upon crystal growth. The proposed model for this crack formation probably reflects the negative role of some Al- and especially Mg-bearing minerals in the coal blends used for the production of coke, and partly reveals mineralogical insights into the negative influence of high ash basicity on coke strength.},

	abstract = {With the increasing interest in unconventional resource plays, there have been important changes in the way how reservoirs and their attributes are assessed and characterized. Of particular relevance to the development of unconventional plays has been the focus on the assessment of organic porosity. A review of the available literature reveals contradictions with respect to where organic porosity develops (kerogen, bitumen, or pyrobitumen), when it develops with respect to hydrocarbon generation and cracking (within the oil window or beyond), its mode of formation (inherited or authigenic), the influence of organic carbon content, and the importance of organic porosity with respect to hydrocarbon storage and production. Many of these apparent contradictions appear to result from the nature of the data sets upon which the studies are based. Organic pore size generally limits the role that organic porosity plays in liquid-rich plays. From the available literature, it has become clear that there are number of issues that need to be clarified when addressing organic porosity. One such issue is terminology. There appears to be confusion in the usage of the terms kerogen, bitumen, and pyrobitumen. This confusion exists in the literature and reports prepared by various service providers for those engaged in the exploration and exploitation of unconventional resources. Another issue is the observed differences in the morphology of the organic pores (e.g., spongy, isolated bubbles, or fractures). Differences in pore morphology indicate multiple mechanisms for formation and/or growth of organic pores, suggesting more complexity to organic porosity development than often implied. For example, the spongy appearance of organic pores in some systems could reflect the amorphous character of some oil-prone kerogen, whereas the bubble pore character could be the result of degassing during the transition from the oil window into the gas window or an artifact of decompression and degassing as bitumen solidifies during core retrieval. Similarly, fractures could be a result of the conversion of oil to gas and the inability of the gas to escape or could be desiccation cracks, possibly formed after sample retrieval. Organic pores, if present in situ, increase space for hydrocarbon storage and increase surface area resulting in higher absorption capacity. However, the connectivity of these pores may be somewhat limited and may be dependent on the nature of the organic network, thus limiting their impact on permeability. A challenge when studying organic porosity is its observed variability within an individual reservoir. Very different spatial distribution of pores can occur between adjacent organic particles (e.g., macerals, solid bitumen) as well as within individual ‚Äúmacerals‚Äù. It has been suggested that this could be, in part, a result of organic‚Äìinorganic interactions although alternative interpretations have also been proposed. Further complicating the scientific understanding of organic porosity is the possibility that the act of studying the samples containing these pores may result in alteration of the rocks and the pores themselves. Therefore, observed organic pores may not be reflective of native conditions. The lack of a clear understanding of organic porosity development in unconventional mudstone reservoirs is by no means a surprise. Porosity and its development in conventional reservoirs have been studied since Sorby began the examination of sandstone thin sections in 1850 and is still under examination, while organic porosity has been studied for less than a decade. The focus of this study is to provide a review of porosity associated with the organic fraction, which may, in some shale-reservoirs, play a key role in hydrocarbon storage, migration, and production.},

	abstract = {The interface between cells and nonbiological surfaces regulates cell attachment, chronic tissue responses, and ultimately the success of medical implants or biosensors. Clinical and laboratory studies show that topological features of the surface profoundly influence cellular responses; for example, titanium surfaces with nano- and microtopographical structures enhance osteoblast attachment and host‚Äìimplant integration as compared to a smooth surface. To understand how cells and tissues respond to different topographical features, it is of critical importance to directly visualize the cell‚Äìmaterial interface at the relevant nanometer length scale. Here, we present a method for in situ examination of the cell-to-material interface at any desired location, based on focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy imaging to resolve the cell membrane-to-material interface with 10 nm resolution. By examining how cell membranes interact with topographical features such as nanoscale protrusions or invaginations, we discovered that the cell membrane readily deforms inward and wraps around protruding structures, but hardly deforms outward to contour invaginating structures. This asymmetric membrane response (inward vs outward deformation) causes the cleft width between the cell membrane and the nanostructure surface to vary by more than an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that surface topology is a crucial consideration for the development of medical implants or biosensors whose performances are strongly influenced by the cell-to-material interface. We anticipate that the method can be used to explore the direct interaction of cells/tissue with medical devices such as metal implants in the future.},

The emergence of the variab- pressure/environmental SEM has enabled the observation of samples c- taining water or other liquids or vapor and has allowed for an entirely new class of dynamic experiments, that of direct observation of che- cal reactions in situ. Critical advances in electron detector technology and computer-aided analysis have enabled structural (crystallographic) analysis of specimens at the micrometer scale through electron backscatter diffr- tion (EBSD). Low-voltage operation below 5 kV has improved x-ray spatial resolution by more than an order of magnitude and provided an effective route to minimizing sample charging. High-resolution imaging has cont- ued to develop with a more thorough understanding of how secondary el- trons are generated. The ?eld emission gun SEM, with its high brightness, advanced electron optics, which minimizes lens aberrations to yield an - fective nanometer-scale beam, and ‚Äúthrough-the-lens‚Äù detector to enhance the measurement of primary-beam-excited secondary electrons, has made high-resolution imaging the rule rather than the exception. Methods of x-ray analysis have evolved allowing for better measurement of specimens with complex morphology: multiple thin layers of different compositions, and rough specimens and particles. Digital mapping has transformed classic x-ray area scanning, a purely qualitative technique, into fully quantitative compositional mapping.},

An investigation into children undergoing the early stages of physiological maturation revealed that tooth enamel had a hypomineralized structure of the hydroxyapatites crystalline grid a with disturbed spatial orientation and boundaries accuracy, changed organic matrix depth, increased shell size and polymorphisms in the enamel prisms structure along with a reduced density of their packing. The combination of these signs is indicative of incomplete development of prismatic enamel structures with an unbalanced ratio of the mineral component and the organic matrix. Conclusion. The obtained results demonstrate potential use of high-resolution electron microscopy with X-ray spectral microanalysis to study dental hard tissues. Development and introduction of personalized approaches to caries prevention based on selective usage of remineralizing drugs and vitamin-mineral complexes, would improve resistance to caries through all stages of physiological maturation. function show\_abstract() \{{\textbackslash}vphantom\} \$('\#abstract1').hide(); \$('\#abstract2').show(); \$('\#abstract\_expand').hide(); {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\} ‚ñº–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é},

	abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is traditionally the Cinderella of electron microscopy, often seen as a playground for biologists and other disciplines remote from physics, and overshadowed by high resolution TEM, dominated by eminent scientists concerned with atomic structure and quantitative analysis. When Max Knoll in Berlin invented and constructed the first (crude) SEM in 1935 he did not bother to patent it. Some years later, von Borries and Ruska at Siemens und Halske Berlin, the first to realize high resolution electron microscopy in a commercial TEM, learned that Manfred von Ardenne in his private laboratory in Berlin had been given a contract by Siemens to develop an SEM. They immediately requested the management to cancel it as a waste of the Company's money, since the SEM `could never compete wth the TEM in image formation as the exposure time in serial scanning would be impossibly greater than in a comparable TEM image'! This view changed only when field emission guns became available. Many other difficulties were also overcome by advances in desk-top computing. Today the SEM is the microscope of choice in many areas of science and technology. Reimer himself has always put forward the view that it is vital for all users of SEM to understand the physics of image formation, electron-specimen interaction and useful modes of instrument operation. This is best handled, according to Reimer, by a single author so as to ensure a consistent terminology and a uniform referencing system. It is clearly difficult to include all aspects of the subject. The art of the successful author is therefore to know what to omit, both in the text and the list of references, so that a reader can quickly locate his areas of interest and the relevant references. Reimer has honed this skill over a long career, having already published Transmission Electron Microscopy (Volume 36 of the Springer series on optical sciences) as well as the first edition (1985) of the present volume, which records the spectacular advances in SEM over the last few years; these include accelerating voltages down to 0.5 kV and computer control in operation and photography. Remarkably, the Everhart-Thornley detector, arising from an inspired suggestion by Sir Charles Oatley at Cambridge, still holds sway. Nevertheless, other specialized detectors are now also in use. This, together with the extensive use of computers to control the column and produce digital images, stored in a computer, has led to `instant' micrographs and archiving methods. The remarkable improvements in silicon-lithium energy-dispersive x-ray detectors with ultra-thin windows have greatly improved the analytical performance of the SEM, leading to the widespread use of SEM for rapid analytical chemical analysis. One of the curiosities of SEM is that some operators familiar with light microscope images imagine that the SEM image is much the same and can be interpreted fairly easily. This is not true and Reimer has gone to much trouble to seek out the most appropriate theoretical mechanisms for image interpretations in the SEM. The book can be read at many levels, depending on the reader's background and level of scientific curiosity. An attractive feature is that the book is not `dolled up' with striking micrographs that, in fact, teach very little. Instead, each well-thought-out diagram is packed with information, The micrographs themselves, often arranged in pairs, make telling points about items such as crystal orientation contrast in a back-scattered electron micrograph, for example. A word should perhaps be said about the seminal role of Peter Hawkes in `revising the English text' as stated in the Preface. Reimer's English is `almost perfect but not quite', as Ellis Cosslett famously remarked about Jan Le Poole. It is a quirk of the English language that a sentence must `sound correct' even at the expense of the rules of grammar and syntax! Hawkes appears to have brought a fine linguistic polish to an already imposing text. In trawling through 447 pages of text I was able to find only one word that seemed to jar. Page 237 states `...darkroom work is unneeded when images are digitally processed'. To conclude, this book is both linguistically and scientifically outstanding. It is an inspiring book for beginners and experienced SEM operators alike. The `filleted' list of references is especially useful.

	abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is an important electron microscopy technique that is capable of achieving a detailed visual image of a particle with high-quality and spatial resolution. SEM is a multipurpose state-of-the-art instrument which is largely employed to observe the surface phenomena of the materials. The sample is exposed in SEM to the high-energy electron beam and gives information about topography, morphology, composition, chemistry, orientation of grains, crystallographic information, etc. of a material, and therefore SEM is a useful tool to be used for the characterization of materials. Morphology indicates the shape and size, while topography indicates the surface features of an object or ‚Äúhow it looks‚Äù, its texture, smoothness or roughness. Likewise, composition means elements and compounds that constitute the material, while crystallography means the arrangement of atoms in the materials. This chapter is focused on discussing briefly the SEM technique, its utilization, principle, advancement, operation, samples preparation and applications in materials science. We will explain what does SEM mean, what can be done with a SEM, how it functions and what are the different parts of the SEM.},

The task is to find out whether they could have come from the same object. The second aim, when there is no comparative material available, is a classification of the evidence sample into a group of objects taking into account its specific chemical and physical properties. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM‚ÄìEDX) is a powerful tool for forensic scientists to classify and discriminate evidence material because they can simultaneously examine the morphology and the elemental composition of objects. Moreover, the obtained results could be enhanced using some methods of chemometric analysis. A few examples of problems related to the classification and discrimination of selected types of microtraces are presented.},

As the shadowing causes disturbances of the signal flow, a proper design of the detection system is necessary to reduce the errors.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the structures of mesostructured (before calcination) and mesoporous (after calcination) silica thin films and replicated Pt nanowires by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). Highly ordered lamellar, two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal, and three-dimensional (3D) hexagonal mesostructured/mesoporous silica thin films were synthesized by adjusting the concentration of triblock copolymer (EO20PO70EO20; P123) used as a structure-directing agent. Direct HRSEM observation of these mesostructured/mesoporous silica thin films demonstrated that they have inherent external structures on the top surfaces: (1) the lamellar mesostructured silica film exhibits a smooth plane; (2) the 2D hexagonal mesoporous silica film exhibits curved stripes; (3) the 3D hexagonal mesoporous silica film exhibits 2D porous arrangements (e.g. 6-fold symmetry and pseudo 4-fold symmetry). The removal of P123 by calcination had no effect on the surface structure but caused an anisotropic contraction, as found from cross-sectional images. Methods for the formation of the 2D hexagonal mesoporous film affected the orientation of mesochannels. Pt replicates, electrodeposited in the mesochannels of the 2D hexagonal mesoporous silica films, exhibited new structures, i.e., S-shaped, Y-shaped, and swirling-shaped nanowires with ellipsoidal cross section. Direct HRSEM observation of the mesostructured/mesoporous silica thin films on the top surface and cross section provides detailed information on the external and internal structures, which is significant and useful for various applications of these thin films.},

	abstract = {This article concerns the study of polymer composites with anthracite fillers of various structural order. Raw Svierdlovski anthracite of turbostratic structure and the anthracite thermally treated at 2,000$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C of graphite-like structure were used as fillers of low-molecular-weight diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A cross-linked with aliphatic amine. Two anthracites of extremely different structures were compared to natural graphite that is composed of well-ordered graphene sheets. Systematic studies of the influence of the structure of anthracite filler on the curing behavior, morphology, dynamic mechanical thermal properties, and thermal stability of epoxy composite were performed. It was found that the structure of anthracite filler affects the cross-linking reactions of the epoxy matrix as well as the morphology of the composites and their viscoelastic properties. Raw anthracite added to epoxy matrix had a visible effect on the activation energy and differential scanning calorimeter parameters of the curing process, in contrast to the epoxy matrix modified with anthracite heated at 2,000$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. On the contrary, the effect of anthracite on dynamic mechanical behavior of composites is more evident when the anthracite prepared at 2,000$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C was used as a filler.

	abstract = {The backscattered electron signal (BSE) is widely used for investigation of specimen surfaces in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The development of multiple detector systems for BSE signal detection and the methods of digital processing of these signals have allowed for reconstruction of the third dimension on the basis of the two-dimensional (2-D) SEM image. A technique for simultaneous mapping of material composition (COMPO mode) and reconstruction of surface topography (TOPO mode) has also been proposed. This method is based on the measurements of BSE currents sensed by four semiconductor detectors versus the inclination angle of surface. To improve the separation of topographic and material contrasts in SEM, a correction of the TOPO and COMPO modes (resulting from a theoretical description of the system: electron beam, specimen, and detector) was applied. The proposed method can be used for a correct reconstruction of the surface image when the surface slope is {\textbackslash}textless60$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$. The measuring limit of the slope was closely connected with the detector setup. Next, the digital simulation of the colors was performed (after application of the method of linearization of BSE characteristic versus atomic number). This procedure to increase the SEM resolution for the BSE signal by use of digital image processing allows for a better distinction between the two elements with high atomic numbers.},
